Possible PitFalls:

A message could theoretically be passed around in circles seing no end.

MessageContent is TEXT (anything else can be either transformed to text or might want to negotiate to upload seperately.)
Meta is JSON for convenience

Todo:
HTTP Server Respond with Message make easier

Todo:
Logging Proxy Wrapper
Saving logs to somewhere

Eventually:
Make this into a library. Split versions between nodejs env and browser env
